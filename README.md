#### Time Series Analysis of Power Consumption Data

In this notebook, I'll perform a comprehensive time series analysis on power consumption data using multiple approaches including ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX, RNN, and Prophet models. I'll also use Optuna for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Data Preparation and Exploratory Analysis

The dataset contains power consumption measurements along with environmental variables like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The main variable of interest is `Global_active_power`, which represents the household's global active power consumption in kilowatts.

From the initial exploration, we can observe:

1. The data is time-indexed, making it suitable for time series analysis
2. There are multiple variables that could influence power consumption
3. We need to check for stationarity, seasonality, and trends to determine appropriate modeling approaches


The correlation heatmap shows relationships between variables, which will help us decide which exogenous variables to include in models like SARIMAX.

The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test helps us determine if the time series is stationary. A stationary time series has constant statistical properties over time, which is important for many time series models.

The ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function) plots help identify potential AR and MA terms for our ARIMA-based models.

The decomposition plot breaks down the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components, giving us insights into the underlying patterns in the data.

## Model Implementation and Comparison

I've implemented five different time series models to predict power consumption:

1. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A classic time series model that combines autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) components.
2. **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**: Extends ARIMA to include seasonal components, capturing weekly or monthly patterns in the data.
3. **SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with eXogenous variables)**: Further extends SARIMA by incorporating external variables like temperature and humidity that might influence power consumption.
4. **Prophet**: Facebook's time series forecasting model that handles seasonality and holidays well, and is robust to missing data and outliers.
5. **RNN (LSTM)**: A deep learning approach using Long Short-Term Memory networks, which can capture complex non-linear patterns in the data.


For each model, I used Optuna for hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal configuration. This automated approach helps us find the best parameters without manual trial and error.

## In-Depth Analysis and Insights

### Temporal Patterns in Power Consumption

1. **Daily Patterns**: Power consumption shows a clear daily cycle, with peaks in the morning and evening when people are typically at home and active. The lowest consumption occurs during the night when most people are sleeping.
2. **Weekly Patterns**: There's a noticeable difference between weekdays and weekends. Weekends generally show higher daytime consumption as people spend more time at home.
3. **Seasonal Patterns**: Power consumption is higher during winter months (December-February) and lower during summer months (June-August). This is likely due to heating requirements during colder months.


### Environmental Factors

1. **Temperature**: There's a negative correlation between temperature and power consumption, confirming that colder temperatures lead to higher power usage, primarily for heating.
2. **Humidity**: Humidity shows a weaker correlation with power consumption compared to temperature, but still plays a role in overall energy usage patterns.


### Sub-metering Analysis

1. **Distribution**: The water heater and air conditioning system (Sub_metering_3) consume the largest portion of electricity, followed by the laundry room (Sub_metering_2) and kitchen (Sub_metering_1).
2. **Seasonal Variations**: The water heater and AC show the most significant seasonal variations, with higher usage during winter months.


### Anomaly Detection

The IQR method identified several anomalies in power consumption, which could represent:

- Unusually high consumption during special events or extreme weather
- Unusually low consumption during vacations or power outages
- Potential measurement errors or equipment malfunctions


### Feature Importance

The Random Forest analysis revealed that the most important features for predicting power consumption are:

1. Global reactive power
2. Temperature
3. Month (seasonality)
4. Voltage
5. Day of week


This confirms our earlier observations about the importance of seasonal and environmental factors.

## Model Comparison and Recommendations

### Model Performance

1. **ARIMA**: The simplest model, providing a baseline for comparison. It captures the basic trend but misses seasonal patterns.
2. **SARIMA**: Significantly better than ARIMA due to its ability to capture seasonal patterns. The weekly seasonality parameter (s=7) proved particularly important.
3. **SARIMAX**: Including temperature and humidity as exogenous variables further improved the model's accuracy, confirming the importance of environmental factors.
4. **Prophet**: Performed well with minimal tuning, especially for long-term forecasting. Its built-in handling of seasonality and holidays makes it user-friendly.
5. **LSTM**: The deep learning approach achieved the best accuracy for short-term forecasting but required more data and computational resources. The model captured complex non-linear patterns that statistical models missed.


### Recommendations

1. **Model Selection**:

1. For short-term forecasting (1-7 days): LSTM or SARIMAX
2. For medium to long-term forecasting (weeks to months): Prophet or SARIMAX
3. For interpretability and simplicity: Prophet



2. **Feature Engineering**:

1. Include temperature forecasts to improve prediction accuracy
2. Add holiday indicators for better handling of special days
3. Consider adding more granular time features (hour of day, day of week)



3. **Energy Efficiency Recommendations**:

1. Focus on optimizing water heater and AC usage, as they consume the most electricity
2. Consider programmable thermostats to reduce heating during unoccupied hours
3. Investigate anomalies to identify potential energy waste or equipment issues

## Conclusion

This comprehensive time series analysis of power consumption data has revealed significant patterns and relationships that can be leveraged for accurate forecasting and energy optimization. The comparison of multiple modeling approaches showed that while deep learning models like LSTM can achieve the highest accuracy, simpler models like Prophet offer a good balance of performance and interpretability.

The analysis confirmed the strong influence of temporal patterns (daily, weekly, seasonal) and environmental factors (especially temperature) on power consumption. These insights can be used to develop more efficient energy management strategies and improve forecasting accuracy.
